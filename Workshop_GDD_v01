## **"The Workshop" - Game Design Document**
*A birthday gift game about finding comfort in digital spaces*

---

### **📦 CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

**Tagline:** *"A third space between the digital and real, where constructs keep the lights on for you"*

**Genre:** Cozy puzzle/ambient experience  
**Platform:** Web (PWA) - works on all devices  
**Target Audience:** One specific friend (but designed to feel universal)  
**Play Time:** 5-10 minute sessions, grows over time  
**Core Feeling:** Being held when alone, productive procrastination, gentle care  

---

### **🎮 CORE MECHANICS**

#### **Primary Loop**
1. **Enter Workshop** → Ambient response to time/weather
2. **Discover/Receive Pieces** → Through time, interaction, or just showing up  
3. **Build Constructs** → Drag-and-drop assembly, no fail states
4. **Constructs Populate Workshop** → Permanent additions that make space "yours"
5. **Unlock Messages/Memories** → Hidden in radio, pieces, combinations

#### **Piece Discovery Methods**
- **Time-Based:** Morning visits, late nights, specific dates
- **Environmental:** Click radio, watch window, let idle
- **Emotional Check-ins:** Optional mood selection
- **Weather-Triggered:** Rain/storm pieces
- **Special Dates:** Birthday, holidays, anniversary of friendship

#### **Construction System**
- **No "Wrong" Builds** - All combinations work
- **Mood Mixing** - Pieces have emotional properties
  - Midnight (blue/purple) = Rest/Dreams
  - Neon (pink/cyan) = Energy/Rebellion  
  - Golden (amber) = Memory/Warmth
  - Chrome (silver) = Focus/Clarity
  - Verdant (green) = Growth/Patience
- **Persistent Builds** - Everything stays in workshop
- **Blueprint Journal** - Save favorite combinations
